# reforseti

An adventure in Java. Reimplementing `site-rear` in Java, Springboot.

## Aims

- Mirror the API of site-rear as well as possible
- Use the same DB layout. 
- Same Auth mechanism


## Key differences

- The API return shape is now more regular. Refer `ResultsDTO`
- API verbs have been normalized. 
  - `events` is now `event`
